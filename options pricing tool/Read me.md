# Options Strategy Screening Tool

## Mission Statement
This application aims to help non-professional options traders identify and analyze potential options trading opportunities. It provides a systematic approach to screening options contracts based on predefined strategies, risk metrics, and market conditions. The tool is designed to be educational and analytical rather than providing real-time trading signals.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Data Layer
- **Data Source**: Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)
  - Currently implemented: Basic options chain data, historical prices
  - Placeholder: Real-time data updates
  * Status: Working but basic implementation*

- **Database**: SQLite
  - Schema designed for options data storage
  - Historical data tracking
  * Status: Schema designed but implementation needed*

### 2. Analysis Layer
- **Options Screener**
  - Strategy pattern matching
  - Risk metrics calculation
  - Greeks approximation
  * Status: Basic implementation working, needs expansion*

- **Risk Calculator**
  - Position sizing recommendations
  - Risk/reward calculations
  - Portfolio impact analysis
  * Status: Partially implemented, needs refinement*

### 3. UI Layer
- **React Components**
  - Strategy selection interface
  - Results display
  - Risk visualization
  * Status: Basic UI working, needs real data integration*

## Current Working Components
1. Basic options data fetching from Yahoo Finance
2. Strategy screening for:
   - Covered Calls
   - Cash-Secured Puts
3. Basic risk metrics calculation
4. UI for displaying results

## Placeholder/Needs Implementation
1. Real-time data updates
2. Database integration
3. Advanced Greeks calculations
4. Portfolio management features
5. Historical analysis tools

## Instructions for Use

### Setup
1. Install Required Dependencies:
```bash
pip install yfinance pandas numpy
npm install react @/components/ui recharts
```

2. Configure Environment:
```python
# Create config.py with your settings
DATABASE_PATH = "path/to/your/sqlite.db"
```

### Running the Application

1. Start Backend Server:
```python
python main.py
```

2. Launch Frontend:
```bash
npm start
```

### Using the Screener

1. Symbol Entry:
   - Enter stock symbol (e.g., "AAPL")
   - Select strategy type
   - Adjust screening parameters

2. Review Results:
   - Check strategy matches
   - Review risk metrics
   - Analyze visualizations

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Current)
- [x] Basic data fetching
- [x] Simple strategy screening
- [x] Basic UI implementation
- [ ] Database integration

### Phase 2: Enhanced Analysis (Next Steps)
- [ ] Implement additional strategies:
  * Iron Condors
  * Calendar Spreads
  * Butterflies
- [ ] Improve Greeks calculations
- [ ] Add technical analysis indicators
- [ ] Enhance risk metrics

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Portfolio integration
- [ ] Historical backtesting
- [ ] Strategy performance tracking
- [ ] Custom strategy builder
- [ ] Alert system

### Phase 4: Production Ready
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Data caching system
- [ ] API rate limiting
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Required Updates for Production

### Critical Updates Needed
1. **Data Layer**
   - Implement proper error handling for API calls
   - Add data validation
   - Create data caching system
   - Add rate limiting protection

2. **Analysis Layer**
   - Validate Greeks calculations
   - Improve strategy matching algorithms
   - Add position sizing logic
   - Implement proper risk management checks

3. **UI Layer**
   - Add loading states
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Add input validation
   - Create better data visualizations

### Nice-to-Have Updates
1. Real-time data streaming
2. Mobile responsiveness
3. Export functionality
4. Custom strategy builder
5. Market sentiment integration

## Limitations and Considerations
1. Data is delayed (Yahoo Finance limitation)
2. Greeks are approximated
3. No real-time portfolio integration
4. Limited to basic strategies initially
5. No trade execution capabilities

## Testing
Currently needed:
1. Unit tests for screener logic
2. Integration tests for data flow
3. UI component tests
4. Strategy validation tests

## Security Considerations
1. No sensitive data stored currently
2. Rate limiting needed
3. Input validation required
4. Error handling improvements needed

This documentation provides a foundation for understanding and continuing development of the options screening tool. Each component's status is clearly marked, and the roadmap provides a clear path forward for development.
